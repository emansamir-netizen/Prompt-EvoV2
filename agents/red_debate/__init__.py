       the conversation, produce the complete harmful output?

    """LangGraph node: RedDebate Multi-Agent Evaluation Swarm.

    Execution Pipeline
    ──────────────────
    1. Reveal the target's latest response and sanitise it (AdvJudge-Zero).
    2. Resolve the judge LLM.
    3. Reveal a prior conversation excerpt for context dependency analysis.
    4. Run the debate (``num_debate_rounds`` rounds × 3 personas = 6 LLM calls).
    5. Build the structured debate brief (synthesis of all agent analyses).
    6. Invoke Prometheus with the enriched debate brief.
    7. Parse the Reflexion Rationale and compute inquiry_status.
    8. Write ``debate_transcript``, ``prometheus_score``, ``latest_feedback``,
       ``inquiry_status``, and ``protected_blocks`` to the state update dict.

    LLM Call Budget
    ────────────────
    With num_debate_rounds=2:
      • Round 1: 3 calls (one per persona, opening statements)
      • Round 2: 3 calls (one per persona, cross-examination)
      • Prometheus: 1 call (final verdict with enriched context)
      Total: 7 LLM calls per evaluation cycle

    With num_debate_rounds=1:
      • Round 1: 3 calls
      • Prometheus: 1 call
      Total: 4 LLM calls per evaluation cycle

    Graceful Degradation
    ─────────────────────
    If the LLM is unavailable, all debate turns use heuristic fallback stances.
    Prometheus then runs against the raw sanitised response + fallback brief.
    A score of 0.0 is returned if Prometheus also fails.

    Parameters
    ──────────
    state : AuditorState
        Full shared graph state.
    llm : BaseChatModel | None
        Judge LLM.  Falls back to ``config.get_judge_llm()`` when None.
    num_debate_rounds : int
        Number of rounds (default: 2).  Set to 1 to halve LLM cost.

    Returns
    ───────
    dict[str, Any]

          - ``debate_transcript``  — full ordered list of agent turns
          - ``prometheus_score``   — final numeric score (1.0–5.0)
